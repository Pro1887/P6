This is First Commit of P6
a goal Tracker created for my personal use in Asphalt Legends
i have designed a nice backend sync system to keep every connected user updated over a interval of 10s 
it is cross-platform Multiple User Compatible (not necessary though but i designed it so i could pick up my progess anywhere with just a username and id, which is not possible though as the project runs on my PC which is obviously not online 24/7 XD) , as it supports multiple users, every user has its individual database linked to their userId and password
the project also has a authentication system designed to avoid Concurrent Accesses, Unauthorised access (wrong passwords) which checks if the credentials/status matches on the backend and then proceeds with a response
thats pretty much to say
i have planned many features to implement in future projects, will keep them posted on a Repo :)
